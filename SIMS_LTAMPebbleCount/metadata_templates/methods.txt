The methods for pebble count data collection were based on the Wolman Pebble count method. The b-axis (medium axis) of the sediment particle to the nearest mm using a see-through ruler.  Make sure the markings on the ruler have not rubbed off and are very clear (if a ruler is kept in the backpack all field season some of the markings will have rubbed off by the end of the field season).  For measurements < 2 mm record "1".  Do not assume a particle is < 2 mm without measuring it first.  Each axis (a, b, and c) are perpendicular to each other.  It is usually easiest to find the c-axis (long axis) then work in a perpendicular fashion to find the a-axis (short axis) and finally the b-axis.  Sometimes two axes are very similar which will require measuring both axes to determine which one is the b-axis.  Choose each particle in a systematic and random fashion for the entire transect (usually a blind touch with the forefinger off the tip of your boot).  The pace must be consistent for the entire transect although pace can be different between transects.  A transect must be finished regardless if the desired goal is met mid-transect.
